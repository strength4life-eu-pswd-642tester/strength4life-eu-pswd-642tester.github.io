        From my own journey, I know how important true balance is. It’s more than work-life balance —
        it’s about a holistic, strong approach to <em>every</em> part of life. The
        <span class="text-red">Strength4Life method</span> not only impacts your wellbeing directly,
        it also has a ripple effect: on your family, your community, and your organisation." data-aos="fade-up

<!-- WHY BALANCE -->
<section class="alternative-color site-section about">
    <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Why Balance Matters</h2>

    <p data-aos="fade-up">
        Around 1 in 5 adults struggle with stress, anxiety or depression — and many face related health
        issues such as obesity or chronic illness. I’ve seen the toll this takes, and I’ve also seen the
        power of strong individuals to support and inspire those around them.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up">
        A good, healthy balance in life strengthens both your body and your mind. It helps prevent health
        issues, builds resilience, and enhances your personal and professional life. In today’s changing
        world, when uncertainty is the new normal, this has never been more important.

        “I’ve learnt to have faith in my own abilities and to be more confident to ‘try’! I’ve also
        learned more about dealing with difficult situations through resilience and personal strength.”

    <h2 data-aos="fade-up">How Strength4Life is Different</h2>
    <p data-aos="fade-up">
        My approach is real and authentic. I don’t believe in one-size-fits-all coaching — instead, I
        work with you through a <span class="text-red">down-to-earth method</span> that focuses on
        awareness, reflection, planning and taking action.
    </p>
    <p data-aos="fade-up">
        Closely aligned with <span class="text-red">Maslow’s Hierarchy of Human Needs</span>, I support
        you in forming new habits that lead to small but significant enhancements in your life quality.
        And I don’t just stop at the session — I follow up and follow through, to make sure the tools
        we put in place really last.

    <p data-aos="fade-up">
        I grew up on a tiny island in the middle of the ocean — and at 17, I set out to see the world.
        Fifty years later, I’m still on that journey. I’ve lived in Australia, the USA, the Middle East
        and Europe, and I’ve now made Germany my home.
    </p>
    <p data-aos="fade-up">
        Along the way, I’ve worked with people from more than <span class="text-red">100 nationalities</span>:
        in airlines, hospitality, learning & development, and academia. What connects all of it is simple:
        <span class="text-purple">I love working with people</span>.
    </p>
    <p data-aos="fade-up">
        My career started in international travel with Air Canada, Qantas and KLM, followed by hospitality
        management roles with Westin Hotels in Australia and Europe. Later, I worked with the Police
        Services for the Sydney Olympic Games, and with the Learning & Development team at the Burj Al
        Arab and Jumeirah Group.
    </p>
    <p data-aos="fade-up">
        I’ve also trained and lectured at the University of Tasmania and the University of Sydney, bringing
        my passion for developing others into education. Since 2015, I’ve been the face of
        <span class="text-red">Strength4Life</span> — combining all of these experiences into one mission:
        enabling people to live a balanced, strong, and fulfilling life.
    </p>
    <p data-aos="fade-up">
        Don’t be surprised if I turn up to a meeting on my motorbike, wearing my leather jacket.
        That’s me. I love travel, people, food, whisky — and of course, motorbikes.

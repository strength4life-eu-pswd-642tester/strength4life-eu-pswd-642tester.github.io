        <h2>🇩🇪 Willkommen bei Strength4Life</h2>
        <p>
            Ich bin Jon – Life Coach, Enabler, Management Consultant.
            Hier findest du Coaching- und Beratungsangebote für Einzelpersonen und Unternehmen.
            Auch wenn die Seite auf Englisch ist, möchte ich dir hier schon kurz sagen:
            Mit Strength4Life unterstütze ich dich dabei, dein bestes Selbst zu leben –
            in deinem Alltag, in deinem Beruf, in deinem Leben.

<div class="short-bio">
    <p data-aos="fade-up">
        Hi, I’m Jon. I grew up on a small island and ever since I was 17,
        I’ve been exploring the world — <span class="text-purple">92 countries</span> so far!
        Along the way I’ve worked with people from more than
        <span class="text-red">100 nationalities</span>, in airlines, hospitality, education, and business.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up">
        What all these experiences taught me is simple:
        <span class="text-purple">life is about people</span>. Supporting, listening, challenging,
        and encouraging each other to grow.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up">
        Today, through <span class="text-red">Strength4Life</span>, I bring all of this experience together as a
        <span class="text-purple">Life Coach, Enabler and Management Consultant</span>.
        My goal is to help you discover your own strength, create balance, and move forward —
        in your personal life, in your work, and in your organisation.

            <span class="pillars-highlight">Body • Mind • Heart • Spirit</span> – Strength4Life encourages you to be the best you can be!

        <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Strongly aligned to <span class="text-red">Maslow's Hierarchy of Human Needs</span>, I deliver a very realistic approach to a balanced life.
            Working with your four pillars and your own life story, I encourage and provide ongoing support – enabling you to become
            <span class="text-red">strong, mindful, resilient and respectful</span>.

        <h3 data-aos="fade-up">Balance and the 4 Pillars</h3>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Good balance in your life is the synergy of many factors all existing together.
            That’s why I work with the <span class="text-red">four pillars</span>:
        </p>
        <ul data-aos="fade-up">
            <li><strong>Body</strong> — health, energy, daily practices</li>
            <li><strong>Mind</strong> — learning, clarity, curiosity</li>
            <li><strong>Heart</strong> — emotions, relationships, values</li>
            <li><strong>Spirit</strong> — purpose, belief, direction</li>

        <h3 data-aos="fade-up">Holistic Approach</h3>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Treatment for the body, mind, spirit, connections and emotions.
            An holistic approach simply means treating the <span class="text-red">whole person</span> rather than individual symptoms.
            Holistic practices help to regain physical and energy balance in the body.
        </p>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">
            There is much to be credited to the ancient wisdom of our world.
            Holistic therapies have been used for centuries and can play an important role in maintaining <span class="text-red">good health and well-being</span>.
            Rather than addressing single symptoms, a holistic approach looks at the underlying cause – considering physical, mental, emotional, social and spiritual states together.
        </p>

        <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Having a holistic approach to health and wellbeing involves activating the multiple and complex links between
